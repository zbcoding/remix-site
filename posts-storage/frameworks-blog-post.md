title: Angular, Vue, and Remix
---

Angular has many files and many controls. But it can be unwieldy due to the sheer amount of configuration. Vue is a much smoother experience, but can require some setup and customization to get the packages needed for the project. Remix is a new framework, fast and similar to React (in fact, some parts of Remix are based on React). Remix's pages and loading are separated by the url structure, similar to a file structure.
